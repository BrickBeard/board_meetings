# 2019-08-20 Content Creation Committee Report

## Update on Goals
1. Simulcast existing events to two education institutions or public libraries at least once per month during the school year.
 * There has been very little interest in organizing or attending these events.
2. Increase YouTube subscribers to 1000.
 * Done!
3. For each user group with streamed meetups, train at least one volunteer on streaming and at least one volunteer on highlighting Twitch broadcasts and exporting them to YouTube.
 * We're struggling to find enough volunteers. 
4. Identify key success metrics for Twitch and YouTube channels and provide data to VP for inclusion in quarterly Impact Reports.
 * Done! ([Twitch](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/techlahoma/monthly), [YouTube](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1M0FYu5_G_BO8vaEoLHDVASdzifjk8hs0/page/JgD))
5. Create a checklist of our processes to provide to contractors for conferences and workshops.

6. Ensure publishing of all event videos to YouTube within 2 weeks of Twitch broadcast.
 * We're struggling to get this done, since we don't have enough volunteers.

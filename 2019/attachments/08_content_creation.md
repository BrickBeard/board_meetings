## Update on Goals
* Simulcast existing events to two education institutions or public libraries at least once per month during the school year.
  * There has been very little interest in organizing or attending these events.
* Increase YouTube subscribers to 1000.
  * Done!
* For each user group with streamed meetups, train at least one volunteer on streaming and at least one volunteer on highlighting Twitch broadcasts and exporting them to YouTube.
  * We're struggling to find enough [volunteers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkqU4ukKIRQma8J0tLeQL7F2CQxODbeaTTItddvMDag). 
* Identify key success metrics for Twitch and YouTube channels and provide data to VP for inclusion in quarterly Impact Reports.
  * Done! ([Twitch](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/techlahoma/monthly), [YouTube](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1M0FYu5_G_BO8vaEoLHDVASdzifjk8hs0/page/JgD))

# 2019-11 Content Creation Committee Update on Goals

* Done
  * Increase YouTube subscribers to 1000.
  * Identify key success metrics for Twitch and YouTube channels and provide data to VP for inclusion in quarterly Impact Reports.
  * Create a checklist of our processes to provide to contractors for conferences and workshops.
  * For each user group with streamed meetups, train at least one volunteer on streaming and at least one volunteer on highlighting Twitch broadcasts and exporting them to YouTube.
    * We have all the groups covered, but we don't have very many different volunteers. A few people are doing the highlighting and exporting for all the groups.
* In Progress
  * Ensure publishing of all event videos to YouTube within 2 weeks of Twitch broadcast.
    * We've mostly been keeping up with this, but we need more volunteers. We've been discussing the possibility of providing incentives.

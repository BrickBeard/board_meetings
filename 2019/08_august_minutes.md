#jobs channel is the only place the committee really has to moderate.

Lindsey Jordan's work will include membership surveys so we will want to plan for that.

### Proposal: Board will officially meet every other month.

The vote passes with a majority vote. We will not be meeting in September and November this year.

### By end of September, Program and Committee Chairs please report to board on progress towards your specific 2019 goals.

## President's Report

Focus on goals. ThunderPlains is coming up. It is both the biggest money maker for Techlahoma and arguably has the biggest community impact.

## Unfinished Business

## New Business
* Proposal: Board will officially meet every other month
  * Starting immediately, we will change to an every other month board meeting.  
  * Remaining 2019 meetings would be October & December. 
  * If needed, on months that do not meet in which the board requires reports from Committees, Programs, or Officers, reports will be shared via text in approved channels. 
* By end of September, Program and Committee Chairs please report to board on progress towards your specific 2019 goals.
  * Please keep report at a bullet point summary level.
  * Should include enough qualitative & quantitative (where appropriate) data for Luke to use in his comprehensive impact reports to the greater Techlahoma community.
